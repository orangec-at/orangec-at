# Learning from Failure as a Developer

It was a late night wrestling with every possible error while deploying a NestJS project to Docker. I started with a "I'll just wing it" mindset, but eventually hit moments where nothing seemed to work no matter what I tried.

But I made it work. And in the process, I learned more about Docker networking, multi-stage builds, and environment variable management than I would have from reading 100 documentation pages.

## Confucius' Three Levels of Understanding

Confucius divided enlightenment into three stages:

1. **Those who know from birth** - Geniuses
2. **Those who learn to know** - Learners
3. **Those who experience to know** - Practitioners

In my younger days, with plenty of arrogance, I thought I was at least a "learner." Now, I'm grateful if I can become someone who "learns through experience."

## The Modern Developer's Trap

Today, many developers want to know everything before starting:

> "Let me finish the complete Docker guide first"  
> "I'll master advanced TypeScript before starting the project"  
> "Just one more read of the Clean Architecture book..."

But knowing everything doesn't guarantee mastery. Often, those who start knowing nothing but persist through time reach the highest levels of expertise.

## The Value of Moderate Failure

The **determination and frustration** from moderate failure helps you reach mastery more than consuming endless information.

```typescript
// First attempt: "Why doesn't this work?"
try {
  await prisma.user.create({ data: userData });
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e); // P2002: Unique constraint failed
  // What's a unique constraint again?
}

// Later: Patterns learned through failure
try {
  await prisma.user.upsert({
    where: { email: userData.email },
    create: userData,
    update: userData,
  });
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof Prisma.PrismaClientKnownRequestError) {
    if (e.code === 'P2002') {
      throw new ConflictException('Email already exists');
    }
  }
  throw e;
}
```

At first, I'd Google "why doesn't this work?" with the error message. After dozens of failures, I know the cause just from the error code. This isn't knowledge from reading docs—it's **knowledge learned through the body**.

## Failing is a Skill Too

Not all failures are valuable. Conditions for meaningful failure:

### 1. Attitude Toward Producing Results

```bash
# Bad failure: Give up when error occurs
$ docker build .
ERROR: failed to solve...
$ # "Whatever, I'll do it later"

# Good failure: Chase it to the end
$ docker build .
ERROR: failed to solve...
$ docker build . --no-cache --progress=plain 2>&1 | tee build.log
$ # Analyze logs, check each layer, identify cause
```

### 2. Document After Failure

```markdown
## 2024-12-20 Docker Deployment Failure Log

### Symptoms
- `COPY --from=builder` stage couldn't find files

### Cause
- Multi-stage build output went to `build/` instead of `dist/`
- Didn't verify tsconfig.json `outDir` setting

### Solution
- Explicitly set `outDir: "./dist"`
- Match with COPY path in Dockerfile

### Lessons Learned
- Don't rely on implicit settings
- Always explicitly verify build output paths
```

### 3. Pattern Recognition

If you experience the same type of failure more than three times, it's no longer a failure—it's **wasting a learning opportunity**.

## Realizations After 5 Years as a Developer

What I've learned in 5 years as a developer:

**Year 1**: "I don't even know what I don't know"  
**Year 2**: "Oh, I don't know a lot"  
**Year 3**: "I think I'm getting it now"  
**Year 4**: "There's still so much I don't know"  
**Year 5**: "Not knowing is normal, and I can learn"

Looking at junior developers these days, they seem pressured to "be perfect from the start." But seniors face unknowns every day too. The difference is the **attitude when facing the unknown**.

## Practical Guide

### What You Can Do Today

1. **Start building a TODO app**
   - Don't wait for "perfect architecture"
   - Build first, feel the gaps, then improve

2. **Keep a failure log**
   - Blog, Notion, anywhere works
   - The goal is not repeating the same failures

3. **Ask "why?" three times**
   - Got an error → Why?
   - Type mismatch → Why?
   - Didn't check API response schema → Why?

## Conclusion

> What can you learn from failure?
> This is something you'll never know until you actually fail.

Yet the attitude and action of trying to produce results despite everything is what gives you "learning."

There's no such thing as perfect preparation. Start. Fail. Document. That's growth.
