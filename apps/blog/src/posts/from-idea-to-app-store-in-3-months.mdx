# From Idea to App Store in 3 Months

## The Problem

Drawhatha started as frustration, not ambition.

I practice yoga consistently, and I wanted a better way to journal sessions: what I practiced, what improved, what felt blocked, and what patterns I should focus on next. I tried existing apps, but they all had one or more mismatches with what I needed:

- generic fitness logging instead of yoga-first workflows,
- shallow reflection UX,
- weak progress tracking for long-term practice,
- and no practical integration with health data I already had.

This was the trigger for a simple decision: build the app I wished existed.

The constraint was equally clear: I would do it solo, from idea to production release.

That meant every decision had to optimize for one person shipping quickly without building fragile foundations. I needed speed, but not at the cost of future maintainability. I also needed enough backend structure to support sync, analytics, and iterative feature upgrades after launch.

So the project goal became:

1. Build a yoga-focused journaling experience with real daily usability.
2. Deliver iOS production quality, not just prototype polish.
3. Keep architecture simple enough for one developer to operate.
4. Reach App Store release in a tight time window.

The timeline target was aggressive: roughly three months from first concept to App Store.

## My Approach

I chose a full-stack architecture that balanced execution speed and long-term control:

- **React Native CLI** for mobile app implementation.
- **NestJS + Prisma** for backend logic and data modeling.
- **PostgreSQL** as system-of-record database.
- **Docker** for repeatable local and deployment environments.
- **Supabase** for sync-oriented workflows.
- **Apple HealthKit integration** for richer context from user health activity.

The key was to avoid overbuilding while still protecting core product quality.

I structured delivery around vertical slices:

1. Daily practice log and timeline foundation.
2. Session details + notes + consistency tracking.
3. Sync reliability and backend robustness.
4. HealthKit integration and production hardening.
5. App Store submission compliance and release pipeline.

This sequence helped me keep momentum. Instead of chasing architectural perfection, I shipped user-visible value every week and improved from real usage signals.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1) Why React Native CLI over Expo

Expo is excellent for many products, but for this project I needed tighter native control and predictable iOS integration behavior over time.

Trade-off:

- **Expo pros**: Faster early setup, smoother defaults.
- **CLI pros (chosen)**: Lower abstraction for native integration constraints and release-specific control.

For a long-lived product where I expected deeper native work (including HealthKit nuance), React Native CLI gave me confidence in platform-level flexibility.

### 2) Backend architecture: NestJS + Prisma + Docker

As a solo developer, I needed a backend stack that stayed understandable under change.

- **NestJS** gave clear modular boundaries.
- **Prisma** provided typed schema workflows and migration clarity.
- **Docker** removed environment drift from local-to-deploy transitions.

The main trade-off was setup overhead compared to serverless shortcuts. I accepted that overhead because operational predictability matters more once real users are involved.

### 3) Offline-aware sync strategy with Supabase

Practice logging often happens in imperfect connectivity conditions. Losing entries would destroy trust immediately.

I treated sync reliability as a product feature, not infrastructure detail:

- local-first interaction behavior,
- safe retry expectations,
- and clear sync assumptions around session data.

The lesson here is simple: wellness products need calm UX. Sync uncertainty creates cognitive noise users do not forgive.

### 4) HealthKit integration as meaningful context, not gimmick

HealthKit integration was not added for marketing language. It was intended to improve reflection context for practice sessions.

The challenge was data interpretation and UX clarity: health-adjacent data can confuse users if surfaced without actionable framing.

I kept integration scoped to practical utility and avoided overcomplicated dashboards in early releases.

### 5) App Store review and compliance discipline

Shipping to App Store solo is partly a technical challenge and partly a process challenge.

I had to handle:

- policy compliance,
- metadata and privacy expectations,
- and release quality standards under limited team resources.

A major decision was to reduce novelty in risky areas before submission and keep core flows stable. The fastest route to release was not adding more features; it was reducing review friction.

## Results

Drawhatha shipped to the App Store in about three months as a solo full-stack project.

What this delivered in concrete output terms:

- **Idea -> production App Store release** in a tight solo timeline.
- **End-to-end full-stack implementation** across mobile app, backend, data model, and deployment setup.
- **HealthKit integration** to support richer session context.
- **Live product operations** with ongoing feedback-driven iteration after launch.

Beyond launch, the project gave me full lifecycle ownership experience:

1. Product framing,
2. architecture decisions,
3. implementation,
4. deployment,
5. release compliance,
6. post-launch iteration.

For freelance and product work, this matters because clients rarely need just code output. They need someone who can make practical decisions under constraints and deliver reliable product outcomes.

Drawhatha proved that with disciplined scope and decision-focused execution, one developer can ship and operate a meaningful product in a short window.
