In this process, I've developed a keen interest in understanding complex data flows across various domains and restructuring them into user-centered interfaces.\n\nDesigning reusable components and establishing design systems based on them has been a particularly rewarding growth experience.\n\nI don't just stop at 'implementation' - I think and act in ways that enhance the entire team's productivity.",
