# MVP Validation Guide

Validate your idea before writing code.

## 3-Step Validation

### 1. Problem Interviews (Week 1)
- Talk to 10 potential users (30min each)
- Ask: "How do you currently solve [problem]?"
- Listen for pain points, don't pitch solution
- **Green light**: 7+ confirm problem is painful

### 2. Landing Page Test (Week 2)
- Create simple landing page explaining solution
- Add email signup or "Get early access"
- Run $50 in ads or share on Twitter/Reddit
- **Green light**: 5%+ conversion to email signup

### 3. Pre-Sale / Prototype (Week 3)
- Build mockups or no-code prototype
- Offer pre-sale discount (50% off)
- Show to 20 people from step 1-2
- **Green light**: 3+ pay for pre-sale
