# Pricing Calculator & Revenue Model

Calculate your pricing and revenue potential.

## Pricing Formula

\`\`\`
Value Delivered / 10 = Monthly Price
\`\`\`

**Example**:
- Tool saves 10 hours/month
- User values time at $50/hour
- Value = $500/month
- Price = $50/month

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative

\`\`\`
Month 1: 10 users × $29 = $290 MRR
Month 2: 25 users × $29 = $725 MRR  
Month 3: 50 users × $29 = $1,450 MRR
Month 6: 150 users × $29 = $4,350 MRR
Month 12: 300 users × $29 = $8,700 MRR
\`\`\`

### Optimistic

\`\`\`
Month 1: 50 users × $29 = $1,450 MRR
Month 3: 200 users × $29 = $5,800 MRR
Month 6: 500 users × $29 = $14,500 MRR
Month 12: 1000 users × $29 = $29,000 MRR
\`\`\`

## Key Metrics

### Churn Rate
- Good: <5% monthly
- Average: 5-10% monthly
- Bad: >10% monthly

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
\`\`\`
Total Marketing Spend / New Customers = CAC
\`\`\`

Target: CAC < 1/3 of Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
\`\`\`
Average Revenue Per User × Average Customer Lifespan = LTV
\`\`\`

**Example**:
- $29/month × 12 months = $348 LTV
- Target CAC: <$116
