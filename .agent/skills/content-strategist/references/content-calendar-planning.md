# Content Calendar Planning

Best practices for planning and maintaining a consistent content calendar.

## Monthly Planning Workflow

### Step 1: Set Publishing Frequency

**Options**:
- **3x/week** (12 posts/month) - Sustainable for solo creators
- **4x/week** (16 posts/month) - Aggressive but achievable
- **5x/week** (20 posts/month) - Team or full-time effort

**Recommended**: Start with 3x/week, scale to 4x when consistent

### Step 2: Choose Publishing Days

**Best Days** (Tech/Developer Audience):
- Monday (start of work week)
- Wednesday (mid-week)
- Friday (weekend reading prep)

**Avoid**:
- Weekends (lower engagement)
- Holidays
- Major event days (low attention)

### Step 3: Balance Content Types

**40/30/20/10 Rule**:
- 40% Educational (tutorials, guides)
- 30% Showcases (projects, case studies)
- 20% Opinions (insights, analysis)
- 10% News (industry updates, trends)

**Example Month** (12 posts):
- 5 Educational
- 4 Showcases
- 2 Opinions
- 1 News

## Content Themes by Week

**Week 1: Educational Focus**
- Monday: Tutorial
- Wednesday: Guide
- Friday: How-to

**Week 2: Showcase + Opinion**
- Monday: Project showcase
- Wednesday: Opinion/analysis
- Friday: Educational

**Week 3: Deep Dive**
- Monday: Educational (long-form)
- Wednesday: Showcase
- Friday: Educational

**Week 4: Trends + Wrap-up**
- Monday: Industry news
- Wednesday: Showcase
- Friday: Opinion/recap

## Calendar Template Structure

**For Each Post, Track**:
- Publishing date
- Working title
- Primary keyword
- Content type (Educational/Showcase/Opinion/News)
- Target word count
- Status (Idea → Outlined → Drafted → Edited → Published)
- Related posts (for internal linking)
- Social distribution plan

## Staying Ahead

**Buffer Rule**: Stay 2-4 weeks ahead

**Week 0**: Outlining week 4 posts
**Week 1**: Drafting week 3 posts, publishing week 1
**Week 2**: Editing week 3, drafting week 4, publishing week 2
**Week 3**: Editing week 4, drafting week 5, publishing week 3

**Benefits**:
- No last-minute panic
- Time for quality
- Flexibility for trending topics
- Consistent publishing

## Handling Trending Topics

**Option 1**: Flexible Slot
- Reserve one slot per month for "hot topic"
- Can swap with planned content if trend emerges

**Option 2**: Quick Turn

- Can publish trend content quickly

**When to Jump on Trends**:
- Major framework release (React 19, Next.js 15)
- Breaking changes
