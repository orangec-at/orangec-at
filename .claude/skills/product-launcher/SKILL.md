# Product Launcher

Transform your side projects into real products that users love and pay for.

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Perfect for**:
- Validating product ideas before building
- Creating launch checklists for side projects
- Planning user acquisition strategies
- Designing pricing and monetization
- Going from "hobby project" to "real product"
- Finding product-market fit

**Triggers**: product launch, MVP, validation, monetization, pricing, startup

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Validate Before Build**
Don't build for 6 months in isolation. Validate the problem first.

### 2. **Launch Fast, Iterate Faster**
Ship an imperfect MVP. Learn from real users.

### 3. **Distribution > Product**
Great product + no distribution = failure
Good product + great distribution = success

### 4. **Monetize Early**
If people won't pay, they don't really want it.

---

## Workflow 1: Idea Validation

**Goal**: Confirm people have this problem BEFORE building

### Step 1: Problem Validation

**Ask**:
- Who has this problem? (Be specific: "frontend developers" not "developers")
- How are they solving it now? (Competitors, workarounds)
- How painful is it? (Nice-to-have vs must-have)
- Will they pay for a solution?

**Validation Methods**:
1. **Interview 10 potential users** (30min each)
2. **Analyze competitor reviews** (what do users complain about?)
3. **Create landing page** (measure email signups before building)

**Green Lights** (Build it):
- Users describe problem without prompting
- Current solutions are expensive or complicated
- 10+ people say "I'd pay for this"

**Red Flags** (Don't build):
- You have to explain the problem to users
- Current free solutions work well enough
- "It's a cool idea" but no commitment to pay

---

### Step 2: MVP Scope

**MVP = Minimum Viable Product**

**Include**:
- ONE core feature that solves the main problem
- Basic auth (if needed)
- Simple payment (if monetized)
- Landing page explaining value

**Exclude from MVP**:
- Advanced features
- Perfect UI/UX
- Complex integrations
- Mobile app (web first!)

**Example**:

**Full Vision**: "Analytics platform with AI insights, team collaboration, custom dashboards"

**MVP**: "Simple analytics dashboard showing top 5 metrics, one user, $10/month"

## Workflow 2: Launch Checklist

**Goal**: Ship your MVP in 4 weeks

### Pre-Launch (Week 1-3)

**Product**:
- [ ] One core feature works
- [ ] Landing page live
- [ ] Payment integration (if paid)
- [ ] Basic auth/signup

**Distribution Setup**:
- [ ] Twitter/X account created
- [ ] ProductHunt profile ready
- [ ] Relevant subreddits identified
- [ ] Email list for early access (even if 0 subscribers)

**Content**:
- [ ] Demo video (2 minutes)
- [ ] 3 screenshots
- [ ] "How it works" explanation
- [ ] Pricing page

---

### Launch Day (Week 4)

**Morning**:
- [ ] ProductHunt submission (12:01am PT)
- [ ] Tweet announcement
- [ ] Post to Reddit (value-first, not spammy)
- [ ] Email your list

**Throughout Day**:
- [ ] Respond to ALL comments
- [ ] Fix critical bugs immediately
- [ ] Thank every user

**End of Day**:
- [ ] Review feedback
- [ ] Plan Week 2 improvements

---

## Workflow 3: User Acquisition

**Goal**: Get first 100 users

### Free Channels (0-100 users)

**1. ProductHunt** (High effort, high reward)
- Launch on Tuesday-Thursday
- Prepare 5 friends to upvote/comment early
- Respond to every comment within 30min

**2. Reddit** (Medium effort, medium reward)
- Find 3-5 relevant subreddits
- Contribute value first (comments, help)
- Share your product as solution to specific problems
- Never spam

**3. Twitter/X** (Low effort, compounding)
- Tweet progress daily (#buildinpublic)
- Share lessons learned
- Engage with similar builders
- Growth is slow but loyal

**4. Indie Hackers / Dev.to** (Medium effort)
- Share launch story
- Focus on lessons, not promotion
- Engage with community

**5. Direct Outreach** (High effort, immediate)
- Email 10 people who fit your target user
- Offer free access for feedback
- Ask for testimonials

---

### Paid Channels (100-1000 users)

**Google Ads**:
- Start with $10/day
- Target specific keywords
- Optimize for signups, not clicks

**Facebook/Instagram Ads**:
- $20/day budget
- Lookalike audiences
- A/B test creatives

**Reddit Ads**:
- Underpriced vs Facebook
- Target specific subreddits

---

## Workflow 4: Pricing Strategy

**Goal**: Choose pricing that maximizes revenue and growth

### Pricing Models

**Free + Paid (Freemium)**:
- **Good for**: Tools, SaaS with network effects
- **Example**: Notion, Figma
- **Free tier**: Limited features or usage
- **Paid tier**: $10-30/month

**Free Trial → Paid**:
- **Good for**: B2B SaaS
- **Trial**: 7-14 days full access
- **Paid**: $20-100/month

**One-Time Purchase**:
- **Good for**: Tools, courses, templates
- **Price**: $29-299 depending on value

**Tiers**:
- **Starter**: $9/month (individuals)
- **Pro**: $29/month (power users)
- **Team**: $99/month (teams)

---

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchoring**:
Show expensive tier first to make mid-tier seem reasonable

**Value-Based**:
Price based on value delivered, not cost to build
- "Save 10 hours/week" → Charge $50/month (not $5)

**Start High**:
Easier to lower prices than raise them
Launch at $29/month, not $9

---

## Workflow 5: Product-Market Fit

**Goal**: Know if you're on the right track

### PMF Signals (You have it)

**Strong**:
- Users complain when product goes down
- 40%+ of users would be "very disappointed" without it
- Organic referrals happening
- Retention > 40% after 30 days

**Weak**:
- Need to convince people to try it
- Users churn quickly
- No word-of-mouth growth

---

### Pivot Indicators (Consider changing)

**Red Flags**:
- <10% retention after 30 days
- No one willing to pay
- Building features no one uses
- Competitor doing 10x your growth

**When to Pivot**:
- After 3 months of no traction
- After talking to 50+ users
- After trying multiple acquisition channels
