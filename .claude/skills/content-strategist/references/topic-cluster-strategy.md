# Topic Cluster Strategy

Build topical authority with pillar + cluster content architecture.

## Topic Cluster Structure

```
        [Pillar Page]
      (3000+ words, broad)
             |
    /--------+--------\
[Cluster] [Cluster] [Cluster]
(1500-2000 (1500-2000 (1500-2000
  words)     words)     words)
```

## Choosing Pillar Topics

**Criteria**:
- Broad enough for 8-10 subtopics
- High search volume keyword
- Core to your expertise
- Aligns with business/career goals

**Examples**:
- "Complete Next.js Guide" (broad framework)
- "React State Management" (specific domain)
- "Full-Stack TypeScript" (tech stack)

## Identifying Cluster Topics

**WebSearch Queries**:
```
"[pillar topic] tutorial"
"[pillar topic] best practices"
"[pillar topic] common mistakes"
"[pillar topic] advanced techniques"
"how to [action] with [pillar topic]"
```

**Look For**:
- Frequently asked questions
- Specific techniques/patterns
- Tool comparisons
- Common problems
- Advanced features

## Example Clusters

### Cluster 1: React Performance

**Pillar**: "Complete React Performance Guide" (3500 words)

**Clusters**:
1. React.memo vs useMemo - When to Use Each
2. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists
3. Code Splitting Strategies with React.lazy
4. React Profiler - Finding Performance Bottlenecks
5. Optimizing React Context Performance
6. Web Workers in React Applications
7. Image Optimization in Next.js
8. Bundle Size Reduction Techniques

### Cluster 2: Next.js App Router

**Pillar**: "Next.js 15 App Router - Complete Guide" (4000 words)

**Clusters**:
1. Server vs Client Components - Decision Framework
2. Data Fetching Patterns in App Router
3. Route Groups and Layout Organization
4. Parallel Routes and Intercepting Routes
5. Loading States and Streaming
6. Error Handling in App Router
7. Metadata and SEO in Next.js 15
8. Caching Strategies Explained

## Internal Linking Strategy

**From Pillar to Clusters**:
- Link to each cluster in relevant pillar section
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Link in table of contents

**From Clusters to Pillar**:
- Link back in introduction
- Reference pillar for broader context
- Link in conclusion ("Learn more in our complete guide")

**Between Clusters**:
- Link related clusters to each other
- "Also see: [related cluster topic]"

## Publishing Schedule

**Option A - Sequential** (10 weeks):
- Week 1: Publish pillar
- Weeks 2-10: One cluster per week

**Option B - Gradual** (4 months):
- Month 1: Publish pillar
- Months 2-4: 2-3 clusters per month

**Recommended**: Option B allows iteration based on feedback

## Benefits

1. **SEO**: Topical authority signals to search engines
2. **Comprehensiveness**: Cover topic from all angles
3. **Traffic**: Each cluster drives traffic to pillar
4. **Repurposing**: Turn pillar into course, video series
5. **Authority**: Demonstrate deep expertise

## Tracking Cluster Performance

Monitor:
- Pillar page traffic growth
- Cluster pages driving most pillar visits
- Internal link click-through rates
- Keyword rankings for cluster topics
- Time on site for cluster visitors
