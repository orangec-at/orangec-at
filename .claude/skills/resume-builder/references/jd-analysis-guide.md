## Skill Matching System

\`\`\`
Must-Have Skills Matched / Total Must-Have = Match Score
\`\`\`

## ATS Keyword Optimization

### How ATS Works

**Scans for**:

## Company Research Checklist

**Before applying**, research:

- [ ] **Product**: What do they build? Who uses it?
- [ ] **Tech Stack**: Official blog/careers page often lists it

## Red Flags in JDs

**Avoid if you see**:
- "Rockstar", "Ninja", "Guru" (unprofessional)
- Unrealistic requirements ("5+ years React 19" when React 19 is 6 months old)
- Excessive responsibilities with junior salary
- "Must work 60+ hours" (poor work-life balance)
- Vague job description (company doesn't know what they want)
