# Resume Builder

Transform your project experience into compelling, role-specific resumes and cover letters that land interviews.

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Perfect for**:
- Creating tailored resumes for specific job applications
- Analyzing job descriptions to match your skills
- Writing achievement bullets in STAR format
- Converting projects into resume-worthy accomplishments
- Generating company-specific cover letters
- Preparing for career transitions (e.g., frontend → fullstack)

**Triggers**: resume, CV, job application, JD analysis, cover letter, STAR method

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Tailor, Don't Template**
One-size-fits-all resumes get rejected. Customize for each role.

### 2. **Metrics Over Duties**
Show what you achieved, not what you were responsible for.

❌ "Responsible for frontend development"
✅ "Built React dashboard reducing load time by 65%, used by 500+ daily users"

### 3. **STAR Everything**
Structure achievements: Situation → Task → Action → Result

### 4. **Keywords Matter**
Use exact tech stack from JD for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.

---

## Workflow 1: JD Analysis

**Goal**: Extract requirements and keywords from job description

### Step 1: Identify Must-Have Skills

**Extract from JD**:
- **Required Skills**: Technologies you MUST have
- **Preferred Skills**: Nice-to-haves that boost your chances
- **Soft Skills**: Leadership, communication, collaboration
- **Experience Level**: Junior (0-2y), Mid (2-5y), Senior (5+y)

**Template**:
\`\`\`
JD: [Company] - [Role Title]

MUST HAVE:
- Tech: [List required technologies]
- Experience: [Years and type]
- Domain: [Industry knowledge]

NICE TO HAVE:
- [Preferred skills]

KEYWORDS (for ATS):
- [Tech stack keywords to include]
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Match Your Skills

**Scoring System**:
- **90-100%**: Perfect match - apply immediately
- **75-89%**: Strong match - highlight transferable skills
- **60-74%**: Stretch role - emphasize learning ability
- **Below 60%**: Skip or build skills first

---

## Workflow 2: Project → Resume Bullets

**Goal**: Transform projects into quantified achievements

### The STAR Formula

\`\`\`
Situation: [Problem context]
Task: [Your responsibility]
Action: [What you did]
Result: [Quantified outcome]
\`\`\`

### Bullet Structure

\`\`\`
[Action Verb] + [What] + [How] + [Result]
\`\`\`

**Examples**:

**Before**:
> Built a dashboard with React

**After (STAR)**:
> Developed React analytics dashboard with real-time data visualization, reducing executive reporting time from 5 hours to 30 minutes weekly and improving decision-making speed by 60%

---

**Before**:
> Optimized the website

**After (STAR)**:
> Engineered performance optimizations (image compression, code splitting, CDN integration) that reduced page load time from 3.5s to 1.2s, decreasing bounce rate by 22% and increasing conversions by 35%

---

### Action Verbs by Category

**Development**:
- Developed, Engineered, Built, Implemented, Created, Architected

**Optimization**:
- Optimized, Improved, Enhanced, Streamlined, Reduced, Increased

**Leadership**:
- Led, Spearheaded, Directed, Managed, Coordinated, Mentored

**Innovation**:
- Pioneered, Established, Introduced, Designed, Launched

---

## Workflow 3: Role-Specific Resumes

### Frontend Engineer Resume

**Prioritize**:
1. **UI/UX Projects**: Component libraries, design systems
2. **Performance**: Load time, bundle size, Core Web Vitals
3. **Frontend Tech**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind
4. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**

**Sample Bullets**:
- "Architected component library with 50+ reusable React components, reducing UI development time by 40% across 3 products"
- "Optimized Core Web Vitals achieving 98 Lighthouse score, improving SEO rankings and user engagement by 25%"

---

### Backend Engineer Resume

**Prioritize**:
1. **API Design**: REST, GraphQL, tRPC
2. **Database**: Optimization, scaling, migrations
3. **Performance**: Response time, throughput, caching
4. **Infrastructure**: Docker, CI/CD, monitoring

**Sample Bullets**:
- "Designed RESTful API serving 1M requests/day with 99.95% uptime and 85ms average response time"
- "Optimized database queries reducing API latency from 450ms to 85ms through indexing and caching strategies"

---

### Fullstack Engineer Resume

**Prioritize**:
1. **End-to-End Features**: Full stack ownership
2. **Cross-Stack Tech**: React + Node, Next.js + Prisma
3. **System Design**: Architecture decisions

**Sample Bullets**:
