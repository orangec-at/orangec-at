# Social Media Writer

Transform your blog posts and projects into engaging social media content optimized for each platform's unique format and audience.

**Works With:** WebSearch MCP (trending hashtags, viral patterns) • vault/business/ marketing templates • apps/blog/ content

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Repurposing blog posts for social distribution
- Creating Twitter/X threads from technical content
- Designing Instagram carousels from project showcases
- Crafting LinkedIn articles from blog posts
- Writing Facebook posts for community engagement
- Cross-platform content strategy and planning
- Maximizing reach of existing blog content

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Platform-Specific Optimization

Each platform has unique format requirements, character limits, and audience expectations:

- **Twitter/X**: Threads (7-10 tweets), hooks, numbered lists, code snippets as images
- **Instagram**: Carousels (8-10 slides), visual-first, story-based captions, hashtags
- **LinkedIn**: Professional articles (1000-1500 words), industry insights, networking CTAs
- **Facebook**: Community posts (200-400 words), questions, group sharing

### 2. Hook-First Writing

Capture attention in the first 3 seconds:
- Lead with the problem or surprising insight
- Use numbers ("5 ways...", "3x faster...")
- Ask provocative questions
- Share contrarian opinions
- Reference pain points

### 3. Value-Dense Content

Every word must earn its place:
- Cut fluff and filler words
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Include actionable takeaways
- Show, don't just tell
- End with clear next steps

### 4. CTA Strategy

Drive traffic back to your blog/portfolio:
- Natural CTAs that provide value ("Full guide: [link]")
- Multiple touchpoints (thread end, bio, comments)
- Platform-specific CTA formats
- Track click-through rates

## Platform Workflows

### Twitter/X Thread Workflow

**Goal**: Transform blog post into engaging 7-10 tweet thread

#### Step 1: Extract Key Points

Read blog post and identify:
- Main problem statement
- 5-7 key insights or techniques
- Results/metrics achieved
- One main CTA

**Example from TailwindCSS blog post**:
- Problem: CSS naming conflicts waste 40% dev time
- Insight 1: Utility-first approach eliminates naming decisions
- Insight 2: Component architecture provides reusability
- Insight 3: Atomic design pattern scales well
- Result: 50% less CSS, 2x faster styling
- CTA: Full guide with code examples

#### Step 2: Write Hook Tweet

**Hook Formula**: [Problem] + [Solution Preview] + [Thread promise]

```markdown
🪝 Hook Examples:

Most devs waste 40% of time on CSS naming conflicts.

#### Step 3: Structure Thread

**Optimal Structure**:
1. **Hook** (Tweet 1): Attention-grabbing problem statement
2. **Context** (Tweets 2-3): Why this matters, background
3. **Solution** (Tweets 4-7): Specific techniques, code examples
4. **Results** (Tweet 8): Metrics, outcomes, benefits
5. **CTA** (Tweet 9): Link to full blog post

**Thread Template**:
```markdown
1/9 [Hook: Problem + promise]

2/9 Background:
• Context point 1
• Context point 2
• Context point 3

3/9 Why this matters:
[Explain the impact and stakes]

4/9 Solution #1: [Technique name]
[Brief explanation]
[When to use it]

5/9 [Code snippet as image]
Key benefit: [...]

6/9 Solution #2: [Technique name]
[Brief explanation + visual]

7/9 Solution #3: [Technique name]
[Brief explanation]

8/9 Results after implementation:
• Metric 1: X% improvement
• Metric 2: Reduced by Y
• Metric 3: Increased Z

9/9 Full guide with code examples:
[Blog post link]

[Personal note or invitation to DM]
```

#### Step 4: Optimize for Engagement

- **Character count**: 250-280 chars per tweet (leave room for RTs)
- **Line breaks**: Use bullet points and visual spacing
- **Emojis**: 1-2 per tweet for visual interest
- **Code snippets**: Convert to images using Carbon.now.sh
- **Numbers**: Use "1/9" format for thread position
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 max, only if relevant (e.g., #ReactJS)

#### Step 5: Load Proven Patterns

Reference `vault/business/twitter-threads.md` for:
- Successful hook formulas
- Engagement tactics
- Thread structures that performed well

### Instagram Carousel Workflow

**Goal**: Transform project showcase into 8-10 slide carousel

#### Step 1: Project to Slides Breakdown

Map project elements to slide structure:

**Slide 1**: Eye-catching title + emoji
**Slides 2-3**: The problem/challenge
**Slides 4-7**: Solution approach (one concept per slide)
**Slide 8**: Results/metrics
**Slide 9**: Tech stack or key learnings
**Slide 10**: CTA (link in bio)

#### Step 2: Create Slides

**Design Principles**:
- Big, bold text (minimum 48pt)
- 5-10 words per slide maximum
- High contrast (dark text on light background or vice versa)
- Consistent color scheme
- One main point per slide
- Visual hierarchy with icons/emojis

**Slide Template Example** (YogaDay Project):

```
Slide 1:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Built a SaaS in
    14 Days
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧘‍♀️ YogaDay

Slide 2:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Your name/handle]
```

#### Step 3: Write Caption

**Caption Structure** (150-250 words):

```markdown
[Hook: Problem or surprising insight] (1 sentence)

[Story: Personal experience or context] (2-3 sentences)

[Value: Key takeaways or lessons] (3-5 bullet points)

[CTA: What to do next] (1 sentence)

[Hashtags] 5-10 relevant tags
```

**Example Caption**:

```
70% of yoga studios lose clients due to booking friction. Here's how I built a solution in 14 days.

I interviewed 12 yoga instructors and every single one complained about phone booking chaos. No-show rates were hitting 30% because manual confirmations weren't working.

So I built YogaDay - a one-click booking system that:
• Syncs with instructor calendars in real-time
• Sends automatic reminders via SMS
• Handles payments upfront
• Reduces no-shows by 10%

What I learned: Always integrate payments from day ONE. Even if you think users won't pay yet, they expect professional payment processing.

```

#### Step 4: Hashtag Research

Use **WebSearch** to find:
- Trending hashtags in your niche (e.g., search "instagram hashtags for web developers 2025")
- Community hashtags (#buildinpublic, #100daysofcode)
- Niche-specific tags (#nextjs, #tailwindcss)
- Size mix: 3 large (1M+ posts), 4 medium (100K-1M), 3 small (10K-100K)

### LinkedIn Article Workflow

**Goal**: Transform blog post into professional article (1000-1500 words)

#### Step 1: Adapt Tone

**Blog Tone → LinkedIn Tone**:
- Casual → Professional (but still personal)
- "I built this hack" → "I developed this solution"
- Code-first → Business impact-first
- Tutorial → Case study with lessons learned

#### Step 2: Structure for LinkedIn

**LinkedIn Article Structure**:

```markdown
**Title**: [Clear benefit] - [Context]
Example: "How I Reduced CSS Bundle Size by 50% - Lessons from 3 Production Apps"

**Hook** (2-3 sentences):
State the problem and your credentials

**Context** (2 paragraphs):
- Industry challenge
- Why this matters for business/teams

**The Challenge** (2-3 paragraphs):
- Specific problem you faced
- What you tried that didn't work
- Stakes and constraints

**The Solution** (3-5 sections):
Section 1: Approach #1
- What you did
- Why it worked
- Results

Section 2: Approach #2
[Repeat pattern]

**Results** (1 paragraph with metrics):
- Performance improvements
- Business impact
- Team benefits

**Key Takeaways** (Numbered list):
1. Lesson #1 with actionable insight
2. Lesson #2 with industry context
3. Lesson #3 with recommendation

**Call to Action**:
Invitation to connect, comment, or visit blog for technical details
```

#### Step 3: Add Professional Polish

**LinkedIn Best Practices**:
- First-person narrative ("I", "we", "our team")
- Industry context and broader implications
- Lessons learned and failures (authenticity)
- Professional but conversational tone
- Data and metrics prominently featured
- Clear value proposition in first 2 sentences

#### Step 4: Visual Elements

- **Hero image**: Professional screenshot or diagram
- **Inline images**: 2-3 supporting visuals (metrics, architecture, before/after)
- **Code blocks**: Minimal, only key snippets
- **Charts/graphs**: If showing performance improvements

---

### Facebook Post Workflow

**Goal**: Create community-focused post (200-400 words)

#### Facebook Characteristics:
- Longer-form than Twitter
- Question-driven engagement
- Group sharing encouraged
- Personal stories valued
- Visual + text combination

**Post Template**:

```markdown
[Opening hook: Question or surprising statement]

[Personal story: 2-3 sentences about your experience]

[Value: 3-5 bullet points with actionable insights]

[Question for engagement: Ask for community input]

[Link to full blog post]
```

**Example**:

```
Ever spent 3 hours debugging only to realize it was a CSS specificity issue? 🤦‍♂️

I used to lose entire days to CSS conflicts until I discovered this TailwindCSS + component pattern. After implementing it in 3 production apps, I've reduced styling time by 50% and CSS bundle size by 40%.

Here's what made the difference:
✅ Utility-first approach eliminates naming decisions
✅ Component architecture enforces consistency
✅ Atomic design scales from prototypes to production
✅ PurgeCSS automatically removes unused styles

What's your biggest CSS pain point? Drop it in the comments and I'll share my solution 👇
